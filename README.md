The Goal: <br>
To create a portable lamp which senses surrounding and automatically adjusts to create ambient lighting. Aditional features would include being able to switch between different types of light, eg. white, blue, yellow, and colors. 

<br><br>
Benefit: <br>
This product would help students manage their productivity. For example changing the type of light that a student uses while studying can affect their productivity. Blue light helps the brain stay alert and focused, whereas yellow light can be used to help the brain relax. 

<br><br>
Process: <br>
This lamp was constructed by a group of students, including myself. We used an arduino, RGB LED strip, and a light sensor alongside recyclable materials to create our lamp.
